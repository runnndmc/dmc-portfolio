                <p>Stealing stuff is about the stuff, not the stealing. Aww, gee, you got me there, Rick. That, out there. That's my grave. On one of our adventures Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world. So we bailed on that reality and we came to this one. Because in this one the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, we were dead. So we came here a-a-and we buried ourselves and we took their place. And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast 2 My sister died in the spaghetti.</p>
            <h3>New Alternatives</h3>
                <p>How do you saddle a fart? I don't know man, Italy, Greece, Argentina... Yo! What up my glip glops! Well, to be honest, I'm kind of grossed out with the sexual nature of how everything unfolded. I didn't know how sexual dragons were. I kind of just wanted to do some DD stuff, y'know?</p>
            <h3>MovieWorm</h3>
                <p>Holy crap, Morty, run! Run for your life, Morty, run! I-I've never seen that thing before in my life, Morty, I don't even know what the hell it is! We-we gotta get out of here, Morty, it's gonna kill us! We're gonna die, Morty! We're gonna die! Countries known for their sexually aggressive men. Like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? You know what those guys do in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls and dip 'em in cocaine and wipe 'em all over each other. You know Grandpa goes around and he does his business in public because grandpa isn't shady. Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape?</p>

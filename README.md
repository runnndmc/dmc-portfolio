# Welcome to my Portfolio! 

I've crafted this beauty from a good old create-react-app and have my most recent projects shown. **pretty standard**

Some **Goals** I have going forward, you ask?

<ul>
  <li>convert css to scss</li>  
  <li>introduce better buttons</li>  
  <li>revise code where wet</li>
</ul>

Let me know what you think!
